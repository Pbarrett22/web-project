Hello my name is porter barrett I like to play video games and watch tv. 
I am a student at kennesaw state university and here is what I have expiernced in my time here.
</p1>

<p2 style="color : red; font: 15px; padding:8;margin:5">My first year at KSU was an experience because I had never done something like it before. Living in a dorm was fun and all the activities that I did were fun. It was different because I normally was with my parents, so it took time to adjust. The common hall was one of the best places to go cause of all the food and how calm it was. Classes were different than the ones I was use to because of that second semester I only took 4 class compared to the five class I took in the first semester.</p2>

<p3 style="color : red; font: 15px; padding:8;margin:5">My second year at KSU was also somewhat different because I had gone to a different campus than my first year. This semester I was at the Marietta branch which is smaller and closer together. The classes were the same, some were harder because it was a new subject that I was learning. However, the year was good, and the campus was a fun place to experience. </p3>

<p4 style="color : red; font: 15px; padding:8;margin:5">My third year is different than the other two because I am taking my classes entirely online. This presents its own challenges because there is no teacher showing us how things are done. If I need help, I email the teacher and hope that I get a response. However a benefit is that I can work a decent job and make good money while doing the classes from home.</p4>
